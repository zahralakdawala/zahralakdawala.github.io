I am a math enthusiast: an educator, consultant, researcher and am passionate about promoting mathematics as a key driver for physics and data-driven decision making. Beneficiaries of my work and research are students (graduate and undergratuate), technological innovators, investors, hydrologists and envioronmentalists. 

## Research
My research interests are diverse and I'd group them in the following areas: 
- Complex system of equations that stem from the area of fluid dynamics, flow and transport in plain and porous media, mathematical models for coupled surface and sub-surface flows, advection-diffussion-reaction equations. 
- Scintific computing, numerical and statistical analysis, pyhsics informed machine learning, digital mathematics, numerical methods for partial differential equations and for integro-differential equations (finite volume, finite difference, and finite element discretization), space and time discretization and iterative methods, algebraic multigrid solvers, numerical simulation of (Newtonian) flow and (contamination) transport in plain and (rigid, poro-elastic) porous media.
- Qantitative methods, time-series analysis, spatial estimations (regression kriging), uncertainity quantification, correlation and statistical analysis, portfolio optimization, factorizations, feature extraction, neural networks
- Almost all my work and research has a computational base and most code is written in Python and C++

## Projects
I implement math into practice together with industry and research partners. Methodologically, my research areas focus on modeling, simulation, machine learning and optimization and sets its path for digital twin frameworks. Integral parts of the projects are consulting and implementation, support in the application of high-performance computing and providing tailor-made software solutions. I develop simulation software along with using existing ones, often in cooperation with leading software companies. Nowadays, companies of all sizes use simulations on regular bases which gives them benefit in terms of product innovation and quality assurance. My clients and users are mainly stemming from areas of automotive, textile, finance and environmental research.
