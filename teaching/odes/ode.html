<h1>Ordinary Differential Equations</h1>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<p>The construction of mathematical models to address real-world problems has been one of the most important aspects of each of the branches
of science. Many mathematical models represented as equations involving functions and their derivatives. Such equations are called differential
equations. Equations with one independent variable are called ordinary differential equations. The course will demonstrate the usefulness of
ordinary differential equations for modelling physical and other phenomena. Complementary mathematical approaches for their solution will be
presented, including analytical methods, graphical analysis and numerical techniques. We will use Python for analysing certain numerical
techniques and viewing the solutions of certain equations in an illustrative way.

<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop skills in analyzing systems of linear and nonlinear differential equations using analytical and geometrical approaches</li>
      <li>Learn the theoretical aspects of differential equations, including the establishment of existence of solutions, and techniques
          for obtaining solutions for the various types of ordinary differential equations</li>
      <li>Use the theorems which are especially useful, as they allow one to determine the existence and uniqueness of solutions
          without having to solve the differential equation </li>
