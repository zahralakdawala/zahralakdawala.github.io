<h1>Ordinary Differential Equations</h1>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<p>The construction of mathematical models to address real-world problems has been one of the most important aspects of each of the branches
of science. Many mathematical models represented as equations involving functions and their derivatives. Such equations are called differential
equations. Equations with one independent variable are called ordinary differential equations. The course will demonstrate the usefulness of
ordinary differential equations for modelling physical and other phenomena. Complementary mathematical approaches for their solution will be
presented, including analytical methods, graphical analysis and numerical techniques. We will use Python for analysing certain numerical
techniques and viewing the solutions of certain equations in an illustrative way.
