<h1>Financial Modeling and Applications</h1>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<p>
This course combines statistical concepts and applies into analysing financial data using Python. It aims to provide students with the skills to conduct statistical analysison financial data to make inferences about risks and returns. Students will learn how to use Python to import, prepare and analyse financial data that will then be used to build prediction models. The students will be guided through a series of well designed projects such that they will get to wrangle financial data and implement a few models and algorithms
</p>
<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>The first step to modelling is to clearly define the problem we seek to solve. In the first module of the course, we will introduce the mechanics of capital markets and theunderlying ideas of risk and return. Students will then learn to read and analyse stock data using trend analysis as well as studying the distributions of stock returns and applying statistical inference. We will then introduce one of the most commonly used prediction models, multiple linear regression, and apply it to predict price changes of real-world stocks and indices.

<h2>Python Labs</h2>
<p>We will introduce you to the basics of Python programming, such as Python’s functions and data types, ”for loop” and ”if-else” commands. Further we will see how financial data can be organized as vectors, and the operations that one could potentially perform on them, e.g. sorting. Moreover we will cover the topics of data wrangling with pandas, and data visualization with matplotlib. We will apply the important statistical concepts (random variable, frequency, distribution, population and sample, confidence interval, linear regression, etc. ) into financial contexts. We will import financial data build a model using (multiple) linear regression model and use it to predict price changes stocks and indices. We will evaluate the model using different indicators.
