<h1>Quantitative Finance</h1>
<h2>About the course</h2>
  <p>This course is designed to develop quantitative skills that students require to implement financial theories. As an ever-increasing number of 
    financial services firms are applying sophisticated mathematical models in their trading, pricing, risk and asset management functions, the need 
    for more specialized and advanced courses has emerged where students and working professionals can acquire the knowledge they need to 
    competently and responsibly perform these functions. This course can be considered as a first course in this stream.
